                    <p>Digital Video is one of the powerful means of communicating information / sharing knowledge / reaching audience on the Internet. We all love to watch a short video than reading through a long article to easily consume the content on the go. In the last five years video execution, performance, traffic on the internet has seen an explosive growth. Consumption of video has expanded across all screens, an average adult spends watching around 1 hour 16 minutes of digital video content as of 2015. When video is playing such an important role in our day to day life, it’s good to know some basics about digital video to better understand how things work the way they do.

                        </br>
                        In this below post, I will be explaining the most important and basic terminologies related to digital video,

                    <h3>Pixel</h3>
                    <p>The pixel is the smallest visible entity of an image, video or screen. The screen is divided up into a matrix of millions of pixels. Every pixel is made up of three subpixels Red, Green and Blue. The color of the pixel is the combination of different proportions of the subpixels. The broader the color variation supported for each subpixel, larger is the color pallette available for the screen to display your image/video in the most accurate way.

                    <h3>Frame</h3>
                    <p>A frame is a still image made up of a pixels that shows up for a fraction of a second during a video playback.</br>
                        </br>
                        It has a fixed width and height expressed in pixels. For example, a frames’ size can be 640px X 480px which is a matrix of 640 by 480 pixels with is a total of 307,200 pixels in each frame. Each of these pixels render with a different color based on the content being displayed.</br>
                        </br>
                        You may have heard of a smartphone specification to be something like “5 Megapixel Camera with a Display of 16 million colors”, what is it exactly?</br>
                        </br>
                        Which means there are a minimum of 5 million pixels in every image captured by that camera lens. So you can imagine a wall with 5 million bulbs densely placed next to each other in rows and columns, where each bulb can be lit up with one of the 16 million colors supported to form a frame/ image.</br>
                        </br>

                        </br>
                        </br>
                        In the GIF above, each page in the flicker book is a frame in the “Fight‘ animation and as you can see the time each page is seen is just a fraction of a second. This fast transition of still images tricks our mind to believe that we are watching a video / motion in action.</br>

                    <h3>Frame Rate</h3>
                    <p>Remember, still images = frames. The number of frames that are rendered on the screen within one second is framerate. Each consecutive image will have elements from the previous frame but moved over to a slightly to their new position.</br>
                        </br>
                        The higher the frame rate implies a higher number of consecutive images that show up on screen every second. The higher the frame rate, lesser the screen time each image/frame receives. Higher the framerate, more variations of the movement rendered on screen which causes the video to look smooth.</br>

                    <h3>Aspect Ratio</h3>
                    <p>The proportional relationship between the width and height of a video frame / image. All frames in a video have the same aspect ratio, for example:</br>
                        </br>
                        > Online digital video standard aspect ratio is 16:9</br>
                        > Movies have a standard aspect ratio of 21:9</br>
                        </br>
                        The above ratio is for optimal viewing experience across any video player on any screen</br>

                    <h3>Resolution</h3>
                    <p>You know when you’re watching a video online and it gets all fuzzy? That’s poor resolution. The number of pixels available in an image / each frame of the video is termed as resolution. A screen you are watching on has a certain pixel density or Pixels-Per-Inch, which means it has N number of pixels within an inch of screen. </br>
                        </br>
                        Why does the video / image gets fuzzy ?</br>
                        Let’s say you are viewing on a 10,000 DPI screen (density of 1000 pixels per inch) and the image we are viewing is 100px X 100px image which is of size 1x1 Inch (100x100 = 10,000 pixels in total). Now since the image has same number of pixels as the screen density, we will have a clear picture viewing experience.</br>
                        </br>
                        Now if we increase the size of the image on your screen, either by zooming or increasing the image window to lets say 2x2 Inch. This means we have 4 square inches which is equivalent 40,000 pixels on screen to be rendered by using the same 10,000 pixels available in the image. So we are left with 30,000 pixels which the screen will fill with approximate colors by picking the closest pixel data available. This approximation / insufficient pixel data available to display at the size and resolution of the screen is what causes the video/image to look fuzzy.</br>

                    <h3>Bitrate</h3>
                    <p>Let’s review: </br>
                        </br>
                        > Subpixels are made of bits </br>
                        > Pixels are made of subpixels </br>
                        > Frames are made of pixels </br>
                        > Video is made of frames </br>
                        </br>
                        Bitrate is the number of bits required every second to render/play the video smoothly.</br>
                        </br> It is determined based on the combination of resolution and framerate. Bitrate = Frame size X Frame rate X Bits-Per-pixel. Bitrate of a video also called as data rate determines the bandwidth required to stream this video without stuttering </br></br>

                    <h3>Bandwidth</h3>
                    <p>Number of bits transferred over the network every second. If the user network bandwidth is lesser than the video bitrate, then video will start stuttering / buffering.</br></br>
                    Example, if is a user Internet bandwidth is 10Mbps, which means he can download 10,000 Kilobits per second. If he is streaming a 720p (Resolution) @ 24FPS video from youtube, which implies each frame is 1280x720 pixels @ say 1 Byte / pixel comes out to be 921 Kilobits per frame. </br></br>
                    If the stream is unencoded/uncompressed then it is impossible to stream this 720p video over your 10 Mbps bandwidth line @ 24 FPS. The max that you can stream is 10 FPS (921x10 Kb
                    < 10,000 Kbps) without compression. </br></br>Every video we watch/stream online is heavily encoded/compressed into different formats. I will go over compression/decompression and encoding/decoding concepts in my next blog post. But for now, let 's say our 720p video is encoded at 4000 Kbps by youtube; which means we can easily stream this video over out 10 Mbps bandwidth line with 6000 Kbps more to spare / do things in parallel while watching the video with any stuttering / buffering.</br></br>
                    Try it Yourself! </br> increase/decrease User Bandwidth and video DataRate to see how the network reaches congestion when DataRate gets closer to Bandwidth.</br></br>
