<p>John Kerry is the first SOS using government emails. All previous SOS never had one. The new law is imposed since 2014... So, Hillary didn't have to meet the requirement... There is nothing fishy in this... As an IT professional, I know how the back up are taken with both private and other email accounts as well. There is ZERO chances that her emails would have been lost..</p><p>She also released over 55K emails as a document.</p>
