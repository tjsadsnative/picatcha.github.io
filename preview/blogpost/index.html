              <p><strong>Time to Throw Away the DMV Handbook</strong></p>
              <p>A business would be crazy to force its customers to wait for something they didn’t particularly want in the first place. Consider the added insult of standing in a long DMV line to renew a driver’s license.</p>
              <p>Today, whether we admit it or not, many publishers are taking a page out of the DMV handbook by asking readers to wait for pages to load while they’re populating often distracting, irrelevant ads. Research by the New York Times found mobile pages on 16 of the top 50 publisher websites took more than 10 seconds to load, largely due to advertising content. While popups and banners bring in revenue, they also cost publishers dearly in engagement and ad dollars — especially by popularizing revenue-dissolving ad blockers.</p>

              <p>Publishers need to take a one-two punch approach: showing better ads and serving them faster. Quality native advertising has already started to address the first necessity, with targeted ads that entertain or solve a timely problem for a reader. But unless you build a custom solution for native advertising, the software simply embeds these ads into existing ad servers, adding to the slow page load times.</p>
              <p>That’s why AdsNative designed a brand new way to easily speed load times for native ads: server-side stitching.</p>

              </p>
              <p><em>What is Server-Side Stitching?</em></p>
              <p><strong>Server-side stitching inserts native ads directly into the CMS</strong>, rather than making a separate call for ad delivery. With direct insertion, your ad and content load simultaneously, meaning instant content delivery for your readers.</p>
              <p>But what about ad blockers — the equivalent of driving without a valid license? See, ad blockers work by scanning pages to block domains to third-party ad servers. Since ads delivered through server-side stitching blend into content at the CMS level, they’re not viewed as separate from the content. The ad and your content will always load together, quickly.</p>
              <p>It’s time to save your readers from the DMV line. Learn more about server-side stitching at <a href="http://adsnative.com/server-side-stitching/">http://adsnative.com/server-side-stitching/</a></p>
