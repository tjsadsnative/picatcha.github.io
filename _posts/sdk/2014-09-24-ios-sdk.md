# **iOS SDK**

## Download

<a href="https://github.com/picatcha/AdsNative-iOS-SDK/archive/master.zip">ZIP File</a>

### Installing AdsNative in your XCode project

Step 1. Clone the git repository into your desired folder. 

```git clone git@github.com:picatcha/AdsNative-iOS-SDK.git```

OR 

Download the zip by clicking on the button shown on right of the Github page.
    
Step 2. Drag and drop "AdsNative" folder from the repository into your project's root folder.

Step 3. Check "Copy items...", select "Create groups for.." and "Finish".

Step 4. It should look something like this...

Step 5. Under "Targets -> Build Phases", add the `AdSupport.Framework`.

```

Step 6. Repeat the process for `SystemConfiguration.Framework`.

#### Using AdsNative APIs

Step 7. Add `#import "Adsnative.h"` in your header file whenever you plan to use AdsNative. 

Step 8. Create an ANAdRequest object, initializing it with the zone ID provided to you. You will have to pass this object to most of the requests you make to AdsNative.

```
ANAdRequest *request = [ANAdRequest requestWithAdUnitID:@"INSERT-YOUR-ZONE-ID-HERE"];
```
Step 9. Request that sponsored content make a call to the following non-blocking function:

```
[ANSponsoredStory loadRequest:request
  onSuccess:^(ANSponsoredStory *story) {
        NSLog(@"Title: %@", story.title);
    }
  onError:^(NSError *error) {
        // Oops ad request was not successful
    }];
```

Step 10. Please note that when you create UIView or any UIView based class using the information provided by the above ANSponsoredStory object, you will have to attach that view to the ANSponsoredStory object. The same is true for ViewController or the native browser used by the app to open the sponsored content. This allows AdsNative track various events occuring on the sponsored content. 

The following code snippet shows an example of code that can be used in a table view:

```
- (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView willDisplayCell:(UITableViewCell *)cell forRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
{
    if([[news objectAtIndex:indexPath.row] isKindOfClass:[ANSponsoredStory class]]) {
        ANSponsoredStory *sponsoredStory = [news objectAtIndex:indexPath.row];
        //Configure the ANSponsoredStory on select/tap action here.
        HandleSelectBlock handleSelectBlock = ^(){
            //Begin: Your code - Open the full content view of your choice
            NSLog(@"click handler in block");
            SVModalWebViewController *webViewController = [[SVModalWebViewController alloc] initWithAddress:sponsoredStory.url];
            [self presentModalViewController:webViewController animated:YES];
            //End: Your code
            
            //This line is important and should be called in all cases except for video ads. Pass the full content view as an argument
            if([sponsoredStory.type  isEqual: @"story"]){
                [sponsoredStory attachFullContentToView:webViewController.view];
            }
        };
        [sponsoredStory attachToView:cell onSelect:handleSelectBlock];
    }
}
```
    
Notice that the user click/tap handler also needs to be passed to the attachToView function, which will handle the user's tap event and take your desired action - typically opening a native browser.
  
You can look at the TestApplication provided in the project for a detailed example and instructions on how to best use the AdsNative SDK.
