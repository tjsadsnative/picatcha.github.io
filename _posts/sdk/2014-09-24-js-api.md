# **Javascript API Docs**

In some advanced cases, you may not want AdsNative RenderJS to handle automatic ad rendering (such as infinite scrolling, or if you want to show the native ad on certain user actions, etc.). In this case, you may want to circumvent the RenderJS default behavior. 

Insert the following tag in the HEAD section of your webpage. By doing this, RenderJS will not fetch or render any native ads until explicitly called by given functions. Please also note that you need to include the below code before using any of the given function calls.

```HTML
<!-- Begin ADSNATIVE Code -->
  <script type="text/javascript">
    var _AdsNativeOpts = {
      blockAdLoad: true
    };
  </script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="http://static.adsnative.com/static/js/render.v1.js"></script>
<!-- End ADSNATIVE Code -->
```

### Prefetch Native Ad

You can choose to prefetch the native ad from the AdsNative server for a given ad unit before the document is ready, as well as before you are ready to render the ad. This way there will not be any latency for network requests, and the ad will be for ready for rendering when it needs to be.

All the calls to the API are handled through ‘_AdsNative’ object.

```JavaScript
var keywords = []
_AdsNative.fetchAds(['YOUR_PLACEMENT_KEY-1', 'YOUR_PLACEMENT_KEY-2'], keywords, function(status, apiKey){
  if(status){ //if a native ad is returned
  }
});
```

Above is an example of the ‘fetchAds’ function, which will call all available arguments. You can fetch multiple placements, and specify current page keywords for keyword targeting. Notice that you can also provide a callback for the event that the ad request is finished. The callback function provides ‘status’ and ‘apiKey’ as arguments. ‘status’ is a boolean value which indicates whether there is an ad returned for a current request. Depending on the result, you can take an action. apiKey gives an indication to which placement the call is for. The callback is then returned for each placement.

### Display Native Ad

Once the ad is prefetched you can choose to display that native ad at the desired event. For example in the case of infinite scroll, you may want to display it when the user scrolls down. Or you may want to show it when the second page shows up, etc. You can use the ‘displayAd’ function to show an ad for a placement.

```JavaScript
_AdsNative.displayAd('YOUR_PLACEMENT_KEY-1', 'native-ad-element-id')
```

You need to specify the API key of the placement that needs to be displayed, and then the ID of the element in which the native ad should be displayed. This ‘native-ad-element-id’ element should be an empty div because when the displayAd in included, this element will be replaced by the native ad.

### Complete Example

The following is a complete example, which uses all of the above functions. It is a simple example, where ads get displayed immediately once the page is ready.

```HTML
<html>
	<head>
	</head>
<body>
	<div id="an-ad-abc"></div>
	<div id="an-ad-xyz"></div>

	<!-- Begin ADSNATIVE Code -->
	<script type="text/javascript">
	var _AdsNativeOpts = {
	    blockAdLoad: true
	};
	</script>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="http://static.adsnative.com/static/js/render.v1.js"></script>
	<!-- End ADSNATIVE Code -->

	<script type="text/javascript">
	_AdsNative.fetchAds(['abc', 'xyz'], ['sports', 'autos'], function(status, apiKey){
	    if(status){ //if a native ad is returned
	        $(document).ready(function(){
	             _AdsNative.displayAd(apiKey, 'an-ad-'+apiKey)
	        });
	    }
	});
	</script>

</body>
</html>
```
